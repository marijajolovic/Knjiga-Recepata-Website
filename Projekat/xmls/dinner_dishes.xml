Spread the pizza sauce evenly over the dough, leaving a small border around the edges. Arrange the sliced mozzarella cheese on top of the sauce, covering the pizza evenly. Place the tomato slices on the cheese, slightly overlapping them. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Drizzle a little olive oil over the pizza, focusing on the crust. Bake the pizza in the preheated oven for about 12-15 minutes or until the crust is golden brown and the cheese is melted and bubbly. Remove the pizza from the oven and let it cool for a few minutes. Tear or chop the fresh basil leaves and sprinkle them over the pizza. Slice the Margherita pizza into wedges and serve it hot.</description><img>dinners\9.jpg</img></dish></dinner_dishes>
